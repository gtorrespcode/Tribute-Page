        <h2>Here is the life of Stanley and some of his movies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1928</strong> - Born on July 26, in the Lying-In Hospital in Manhattan, New York City.</li>
          <li><strong>1941</strong> - Studied at William Howard Taft High School. He received average grades, but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age, and taught himself all aspects of film production and directing after graduating from high school</li>
          <li><strong>1950</strong> - After working as a photographer for Look magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making short films on shoestring budgets.</li>
          <li><strong>1956</strong> - Made his first major Hollywood film, The Killing, for United Artists.</li>
          <li><strong>1957</strong> - Made the war picture Paths of Glory with Kirk Douglas. </li>
          <li><strong>1960</strong> - Still with Kirk they made the historical epic Spartacus.</li>
          <li><strong>1961</strong> - Move to the United Kingdom where he spent most of his remaining life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details.</li>
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Made his first production in Britain with Peter Sellers: Lolita, an adaptation of the Vladimir Nabokov novel.</li>
          <li><strong>1964</strong> - Still with Peter, they made the black comedy Dr.Strangelove. </li>
          <li><strong>1968</strong> - Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of the science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey were without precedent in the history of cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation's "big bang"; it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. </li>
          <li><strong>1971</strong> - Made the brutal A Clockwork Orange, which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy—most.</li>
          <li><strong>1975</strong> - For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon, Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film scenes under natural candlelight. </li>
          <li><strong>1980</strong> - Made the horror film The Shining and became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. </li>
          <li><strong>1987</strong> - Made a Vietnam War film -  Full Metal Jacket. </li>
          <li><strong>1999</strong> - His last film, Eyes Wide Shut, was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>“Would I love to do things like that in my own work? Yes. But I don’t think I have the confidence to do that. Which is why there is only one Stanley Kubrick. I do believe he is inimitable. But you can be inspired. You can be inspired to aspire to be that confident.”</p>
          <cite>-- Christopher Nolan</cite>
